### Pizza is Amazing.

Pizza is a savory dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based
dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients
(such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.),
which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.
A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.

> In Italy, pizza served in formal settings, such as at a restaurant, is presented unsliced,
> and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork.
> In casual settings, however, it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand.

> The term pizza was first recorded in the 10th century in a Latin manuscript from the Southern
> Italian town of Gaeta in Lazio, on the border with Campania.
> Modern pizza was invented in Naples, and the dish and its variants have since become popular in many countries.
> It has become one of the most popular foods in the world and a common fast food item in Europe and North America,
> available at pizzerias (restaurants specializing in pizza), restaurants offering Mediterranean cuisine,
> and via pizza delivery.
> Many companies sell ready-baked frozen pizzas to be reheated in an ordinary home oven.
> The Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (lit. True Neapolitan Pizza Association) is a non-profit organization founded in
> 1984 with headquarters in Naples that aims to promote traditional Neapolitan pizza.
> In 2009, upon Italy's request, Neapolitan pizza was registered with the European Union as a Traditional
> Speciality Guaranteed dish, and in 2017 the art of its making was included on UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage.
